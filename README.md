# First-R-Project

This was an R Project where I analyzed data of the stocks of two companies: Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT).

The project consisted of the following parts:
- Part A: Calculating the differential in log returns for each day during the specified time period.
- Part B: Testing for significance in difference between the two mean stock prices.
- Part C: Finding any correlation or significant difference between two stocks.
- Part D: Finding a linear model equation between the two stocks.
- Part E: Finding a linear equation for a 1-step analysis between the two stocks, along with plotting a graph of this equation and finding the associated confidence interval (CI).
